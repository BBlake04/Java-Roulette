# Java-Roulette
This is a slef growth project for a Java roulette game that uses live updating gfx and hashmapping.
The executable jar file is the finished work and will create a DB file named pastguesses.

The idea was to build a full stack foundation that could be easily altered to add components later in time.
There's no points to win (other than pride) but the backend does use SQLite to keep track of player names, and past guesses.
The U.I is attemptedly minimalistic as to get the point across.
Every placement is done by absolute positioning rather than a layout manager because at the time I wanted to do everything by hand.
